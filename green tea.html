      <b>Health benefits of Green Tea:</b>
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 25px;text-align: justify;">
      <b>1. Antioxidant Properties:</b><br />
      Green tea is rich in catechins, a type of polyphenol that acts as a
      powerful antioxidant. These antioxidants help neutralize free radicals in
      the body, reducing oxidative stress and protecting cells from damage.<br /><br />

      <b>2. Improved Heart Health:</b><br />
      Regular consumption of green tea has been linked to a reduced risk of
      heart disease. It may help lower LDL cholesterol levels (the "bad"
      cholesterol) and improve overall cholesterol profiles.<br /><br />

      <b>3. Weight Management:</b><br />
      Some studies suggest that green tea may aid in weight management and fat
      oxidation. The catechins in green tea can boost metabolism and help burn
      fat, potentially contributing to weight loss efforts.<br /><br />

      <b>4. Better Brain Function:</b><br />
      Green tea contains caffeine and the amino acid L-theanine, which may have
      a positive impact on cognitive function. It can improve alertness, focus,
      and mental clarity without the jittery side effects often associated with
      other sources of caffeine.<br /><br />

      <b>5. Reduced Risk of Type 2 Diabetes:</b><br />
      Regular consumption of green tea has been associated with a lower risk of
      developing type 2 diabetes. It may help improve insulin sensitivity and
      regulate blood sugar levels.<br /><br />

      <b>6. Potential Cancer Prevention:</b><br />
      The antioxidants in green tea, particularly epigallocatechin gallate
      (EGCG), have been studied for their potential anticancer properties. Green
      tea may help inhibit the growth of cancer cells and reduce the risk of
      certain types of cancer.<br /><br />

      <b>7. Oral Health Benefits:</b><br />
      Green tea's natural antibacterial properties can help inhibit the growth
      of harmful bacteria in the mouth, reducing the risk of cavities and
      improving overall oral health.<br /><br />

      <b>8. Anti-Inflammatory Effects:</b><br />
      Green tea has anti-inflammatory properties, which may help reduce
      inflammation in the body and alleviate symptoms of conditions like
      arthritis.<br /><br />

      <b>9. Improved Skin Health:</b><br />
      The antioxidants in green tea can help protect the skin from UV damage and
      promote a healthier complexion. Green tea extracts are commonly used in
      skincare products for their beneficial effects.
