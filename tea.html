          Black tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than green, white, and oolong teas. It is made from the leaves of the Camellia 
          sinensis plant, just like all other true teas. The key difference is the degree of oxidation, which results in the dark, robust, 
          and full-bodied flavor of black tea.<br><br>

          Yellow tea is typically brewed using lower water temperatures than black tea and is best 
          enjoyed in a delicate and gentle manner to appreciate its unique flavor profile.<br><br>
          Yellow tea is a rare and prized type of tea that is less well-known compared to green, black, and 
          oolong teas. It shares some similarities with green tea but undergoes an additional step in its processing 
          that gives it a unique flavor and appearance.<br><br>
